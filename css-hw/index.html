<h1>stuff you can get away with on a webpage</h1>

<h2>Keep it simple and stupid</h2>
<p>It's actually good™️ to keep your page <em>as simple as possible</em>. It takes
less work, and the product ends up better.

<ul>
<li>Using fancy colors make your page
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">less readable for people that happen to be
not wearing glassess</a>. You can do fancy calculations, or you can just stick to
the black and white.
<li>Using non-semantic tags make your page harder to understand for people who
depend on screen readers, since they might miss some point conveyed in your formatting.
<li>Writing super long CSS and JavaScript make your page big and take longer to load.
People get frustrated when they wait. Join the <a href="https://512kb.club/">512KB club</a>.
<li>You also save printer ink. The stuff that is more expensive than oil, you know.
</ul>

<h2>Use the new stuff</h2>
<h3>Magically zoomable images</h3>
<p>Have you ever been <strong>frustrated</strong> by blurry illustrations? Do you want to live a life
free of unreadble numbers in charts? Then use the very cool <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics>
SVG format</a>, available since 2001!

<p>Check out this stuff. Use your browser to zoom around. It's sooo smooth.</p>

<h2>Use the old stuff</h2>
<h3>Omit some tags</h3>
<p>Read the source code of this page. You might notice that there is no <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
and no <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>. You don't need them! And it's available since the very first
edition of HTML in the 1980s!

<p>Now check out this table. Have you ever wondered why HTML tables are so wordy? Well, they
are actually not.<a class=ref id=ref_1_1 href="#ref_1">
