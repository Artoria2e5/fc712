<!-- Okay, a note. I am going to really make use of the HTML optional tags mechanism.
     The ones that would pass a validator (not that I will run it for this), not the
     "tag soup" ones.
     
     Why? Well, in the beginning, HTML was something intended to be handwritten. Then
     everything changed when the framework nation attacked...

<h1>FC712 resit things. :(</h1>
<p>I hope I don't miss the deadline on the resit. If you are reading this, congrats &ndash;
   to myself! At least I figured time out. I just need to figure space out too.

<p>I am running on 4½ hours of sleep and no breakfast, so expect this site to not have a real
   focus.<a class=ref id=ref_1_1 href="#ref_1">1</a> If you have any questions about the site, see my
   <a href="https://artoria2e5.github.io/fc712/css-hw/">CSS homework</a>. I wrote some rationale
   there.

<p>I will try to be more focused on the other pages.

<h2>Boring Python rants</h2>
<p>Since I just came here after writing Python, I guess it's time to dump some complaints about the
   language in general.  I mean, I don't really use Python!  Most of the time I enjoy being dominated
   by <code>rustc</code>, famous for its very helpful error messages.
<ul>
	<li>Python needs tail call optimization, because everyone wants to teach recursion.  And recursion
		is in fact cool.
	<li>Their <code>plistlib</code> is incomplete because there's no support for the original,
		human-readable property list. Also, merge my <code>CF$UID</code> pull request, cowards!
	<li>The recent change to a PEG grammar is welcome. Not that it affects me in anyway.
	<li>Please add <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator">function chaining</a>!
		Would someone write a PEP?
	<li>I just remembered that Python is occasionally hostile to functional programming. I remember that
		Python 3 removed multi-parameter lambdas because of "readability", but then they added <code>:=</code>.
</ul>
<p>I am too lazy to find the <cite>Old may yells at sky</cite> picture from <cite>The Simpsons</cite>.
   Search for it yourself for a chuckle I guess?

<h2>Computer… news?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Windows 11 is here! I don't like how they are forcing TPM 2.0 and killing old CPUs for literally
		no technical reason, but at least they promised Android app support! Let's see how far the tech-radicals
		will go this time.
	<li>Some American on Twitter is saying that an empty Tesla was driving around ablaze before being reduced to
		a charred wreck.  <tt>this_is_fine.jpg</tt>
	<li>Oh right, Pride Month is over and everything is boring again! Time to celebrate shame :)
	<li>Is this reading like a series of Tweets?
	<li><p>
		GitHub trained a GPT-ish thing called "GitHub copilot" on its public repositories. It generates okay-looking
		code that may actually be bad, but it sure is fun to see what mistakes it make! It has also read enough 
		English that it is capable of conversation and techno-babble. Hahahaha... Can't wait to try it.
		<p>
		Now some people are upset that the AI is trained on GPL-ed code and might be a form of copyright laundering.
		I am somehow not concerned.

<li id=ref_1><a href="#ref_1_1" class=refuse>a</a> It's not like I write focused things when well-fed anyways. Oh and I can actually say "I'm running on fumes", so that's funny.
